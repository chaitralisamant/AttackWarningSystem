# Adversarial Attack Warning System
Penn State REU Program 2023 P1 Project.

This repo contains all code, data, and images used for this project. The associated paper's Axriv link will be attached below soon.

Two .h5 files are PRETRAINED attack detector models. Associated .ipynb files to create and train these CNNs are also available. 

3 Preprocessing files helped create the datasets. I'm unable to upload the custom datasets onto Github, unfortunately. I can send a Google Drive link upon request.

Images: There are 8 scenarios created for the warning system study. For the patch dataset, I used two patches from previous papers, and I've uploaded the images here for easier access. The associated works are cited in the References section of my paper.

Please reach out by email if there are any issues or questions!
