# Detection and Warning Methods Towards Human-AI Collaboration To Mitigate Physical-World Attacks

This project was part of Penn State College of IST's NSF-REU site for Summer 2023. This repo contains all code, data, and images used for this project. The associated paper's Arxiv link will be attached below soon.

## Files Explained:

.h5 (2): Pretrained Attack Classifiers

.png (2): For the patch dataset, I used two patches from previous papers, and I've uploaded the images here for easier access. The associated works are cited in the References section of my paper.

Preprocessing: Used to create datasets used to train attack detectors. 
I'm unable to upload the custom datasets onto Github, unfortunately. I can send a Google Drive link upon request.

Warning Scenarios: There are 8 scenarios created for the warning system study. 

Attack Classifiers: Code to create and train CNN models, associated with the .h5 files mentioned above.

Please reach out to me by email if there are any issues or questions!
